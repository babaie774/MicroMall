# **MicroShop - A Microservices-Based E-Commerce Backend**

**MicroShop** is a scalable backend application for e-commerce, built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This project follows a microservices architecture, splitting the system into three distinct services: Product Service, User Service, and Order Service.

## **Features**

- **Microservices Architecture:** Modular and scalable structure with separate services for products, users, and orders.
- **RESTful APIs:** CRUD operations for products, user management, and order processing.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Persistent data storage with Mongoose ORM.
- **Dockerized Services:** Simplified deployment with Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Unit & Integration Testing:** Ensure reliability through automated tests.

## **Architecture**

The application consists of three microservices, each responsible for different aspects of the e-commerce platform. The services communicate with each other via RESTful APIs (or optionally through message queues).

## **Services Overview**

### 1. **Product Service**
   - Manages product data (CRUD operations)
   - Routes:
     - `POST /products`: Create a new product
     - `GET /products`: Fetch all products
     - `GET /products/:id`: Fetch a single product by ID
     - `PUT /products/:id`: Update a product by ID
     - `DELETE /products/:id`: Delete a product by ID

### 2. **User Service**
   - Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management
   - Routes:
     - `POST /register`: Register a new user
     - `POST /login`: Login a user and receive a JWT token
     - `GET /profile`: Get user profile (JWT protected)

### 3. **Order Service**
   - Manages order creation and retrieval for authenticated users
   - Routes:
     - `POST /orders`: Create a new order (JWT protected)
     - `GET /orders`: Get all orders for the authenticated user (JWT protected)

## **Prerequisites**

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **MongoDB** (Local instance or cloud service)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerization)
- **Postman** or similar tool for API testing
